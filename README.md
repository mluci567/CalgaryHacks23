# RoomWise

## CalgaryHack23 Submission 

The best group from Mount Royal University :)

### Inspiration

Following covid students are not familiar with campus. We want to facilitate students to be able to use the spaces available to them on campus. Following covid starting in person study groups is hard. We want to create a way for students to connect with each other and support each other academically. Weâ€™re looking to leverage technology innovation to help us build stronger communities.

### Intention

A system that integrates with universities room booking services that allows for users to view spaces that match their preferences. Users can book dedicated rooms and open their rooms to become study sessions. Study sessions are open to other students who are looking to study the same topics. Students can also create recurring sessions that will occur in the same time and place each week. Users can set the preferences for both rooms and for the vibe of the study sessions.

#### Potential vibes

- Covid: Masks on/off, sanitization of space
- Hard core study vs casual
- Confidence in knowledge of topic
- Inclusive space: Gates are open, come on in!

#### Potential space preferences

- Outlets
- Wifi
- Whiteboards
- blackboards
- Accessible
  - Wheelchair accessible
  - Sensory stimulus
  - Number of people in area
- Based on Feedback from users
- Number of seats
- Private area
- Noise level
- Lighting
- Hours(does space close at a different time than campus)
- Amount of people in the area
- Amenities nearby
  - Washrooms
  - food
  - Parking
  - transit
